#Real Time ISS Tracker
## Description
### This page tracks the location of the International Space Station in relations to Earth. The map is zoomed out to the continent level. The space station icon shows the location of the ISS from http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json, being updated every 5 seconds. The icon is centered in the map for easier tracking, so you will notice that the map moves rather than the icon. The google maps default style was changed to Satellite from Map.
## How to Run
### Load index.html onto a browser. Toggle Map or Satellite on the upper left corner to change map visuals. 
## Roadmap of future improvments
### The Google Map styling will be updated to more monotone color scheme.
